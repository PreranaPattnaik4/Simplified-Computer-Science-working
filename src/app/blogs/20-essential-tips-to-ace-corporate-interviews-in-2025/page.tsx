                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                      <li>“Tell me about yourself.”</li>

                <p>Your appearance is one of the first things the interviewer will notice. Dress appropriately for the company’s culture and the role you’re applying for. When in doubt, it’s better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.</p>

                <>
                  <p>At the end of the interview, you’ll likely be asked, “Do you have any questions for us?” Always have thoughtful questions ready, such as:</p>
                   <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                      <li>“What does success look like in this role?”</li>
