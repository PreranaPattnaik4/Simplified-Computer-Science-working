                Theoretical knowledge is important, but hands-on experience is what will set you apart in the tech world. Contribute to open-source projects, participate in hackathons, or start your own personal projects to build a portfolio that showcases your abilities.
            </CareerTip>
            <CareerTip number={7} title="Stay Adaptable">
                The tech industry is known for its fast-paced change. Adaptability is crucial to surviving and thriving. Don’t be afraid to switch gears and learn something new if the industry shifts or if a new opportunity arises. Flexibility is one of the most valuable traits in tech careers.
            </CareerTip>
            <CareerTip number={8} title="Network with Industry Professionals">
                Networking opens doors to opportunities and collaborations. Attend tech conferences, webinars, or meetups to connect with other professionals. Platforms like LinkedIn also allow you to stay in touch with industry trends and career opportunities.

            <CareerTip number={10} title="Understand the Business Side">
                In addition to technical skills, understanding how technology drives business decisions is important. Learn how your work aligns with business goals and be proactive in showing how tech solutions can add value to the organization.

            </CareerTip>
            <CareerTip number={13} title="Balance Work and Life">
                While it’s important to invest in your career, maintaining a healthy work-life balance is equally important for long-term success. Burnout can affect your productivity and career growth. Take time to relax and recharge to stay at your best.
