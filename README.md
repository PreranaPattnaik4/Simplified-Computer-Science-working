# Simplified Computer Science

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About The Project

This website, "Simplified Computer Science," is an educational platform offering free courses, blogs, and resources on computer science, AI, and technology. The goal is to make learning accessible and practical for everyone, from beginners to professionals.

The application is built with a modern tech stack:
